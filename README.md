Hello! I am @veryHechtic and I'm a senior computer engineering student at Villanova University.

I created this new account for use in my Capstone design project and plan to continue using it post-grad. 

I previously used the handle @b-hecht for some work in a software development course.

I am pursuing work in software development.

I am best reached at my school email bhecht2@villanova.edu or on discord Shaggy#6800.
